Crime Prediction
================




Using data provided by the city of Seattle (https://data.seattle.gov/), predicts 911 call volume and category. Only 911 calls are used in prediction, though more data is processed in rb files. 

Rb files create a sqlite db. This can then be used to dump a csv that is analysized by crime.m. Plots.m, plots.r, and maps.r cantain code that can be used to create charts from data.
