Our Vision  Children of all ages and abilities will enjoy the outdoors in the company of their family and friends.,"Digging in the dirt, swinging in the sunshine, chasing butterflies. All kids deserve these simple pleasures. At the Seattle Children's PlayGarden, all kids can enjoy the outdoors?kids on two feet, kids with walkers, kids in wheelchairs, kids who communicate differently.  The Seattle Children's PlayGarden is a nonprofit organization providing children of all abilities full access to outdoor recreation space and offering inclusive programs that encourage every child's potential. The PlayGarden provides a well-designed, safe, and supportive environment to interact with nature, to learn, to explore, and to create. Here children will enhance their cognitive, motor, and social skills?and develop their sense of wonder and independence.  Until now, children with physical limitations, such as cerebral palsy, or developmental delays, such as autism, have been largely excluded from participation in local outdoor activity areas. Parents of children with special needs have had few options of enjoyable yet safe and supported outdoor learning experiences for their fragile children. The PlayGarden offers options for these families that will accommodate not only the children with special needs in the family, but the typically developing children as well.","The lives of families of children with special needs are a constant struggle. Activities outside the home are centered in classrooms, therapy cubicles, physicians' offices, and hospital waiting rooms. I never hear the word fun mentioned."" These observations by Seattle Children's PlayGarden Executive Director Liz Bullard prompted her to form the PlayGarden in 2002. Liz, a Seattle speech/language pathologist, had sought outdoor play spaces that were both accommodating and nurturing for children with special needs. Her research revealed a striking lack of safe and accessible outdoor learning environments in Seattle/King County. She approached Ken Bounds, former Seattle Parks and Recreation Department Superintendent, about this finding. Mr. Bounds agreed, and offered the Department's support for developing this program.  In 2003, the Seattle Parks Department offered the south end of Colman Playfield, at 24th Avenue South and South Grand Street, as the site for a public-private development. The PlayGarden eagerly accepted the offer of this site for the opportunity it presented to involve the residents of the surrounding economically and ethnically diverse neighborhoods and its easy access for families of children with disabilities from all over King County. A 10-year renewable, no-cost lease for the site was ratified by the Seattle City Council in September of 2006.  The PlayGarden became a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in July 2003, and is led by a volunteer board of directors along with Ms. Bullard. A volunteer advisory board and leadership council now assist the group. Committee members have expertise in children's health, children with special needs, gardening, and various business and social services professions.  In 2004, schematic designs and engineering studies were completed for the garden and associated facilities. Construction will be completed in 5 phases. Phase I is complete, and involved moving an existing basketball court on the site, and improving its design to accommodate wheelchair athletes. The court also includes adjustable hoops to encourage children to play.  Construction documents for renovation of an existing Shelter House and a new Garden House have been completed. The permitting process is underway and we are bidding the project, with a groundbreaking anticipated in fall 2008 and completion by September 2009. We are still accepting donations toward our capital campaign, and need to raise $90,000 from individuals. When these facilities are in place, programming will occur year-round.  In the meantime, the PlayGarden has held summer programs since 2006. All programs integrate children with special needs with typically developing children. Programs are often multi-age, to maximize the opportunity for siblings and friends to attend together. Throughout the year, the PlayGarden holds informal planting parties, play dates, and celebrations, such as our Earth Day event in April, Summer Barbecue in August, and Harvest Festival in October.",(206) 227-5458,3710 38th Avenue South,98114.0,-122.28472,47.57028,"(47.57028, -122.28472)"

A tradition since the 1940s, Seattle has hosted the annual African American community festival and parade as a celebration of the city?s ethnic diversity. Originally part of the International Festival, it would be known over the years as the East Madison Mardi Gras and the Pacific Northwest Black Community Festival. It not only has been credited as the inspiration behind SEAFAIR (which emerged during the early 1950?s) but also continues to be held during SEAFAIR?s annually activities.   The purpose of the festival and parade is to highlight the history and countless contributions of African-Americans locally, regionally, nationally and internationally. It is a celebration that gives people for all over Washington and the northwest an opportunity to experience the rich African heritage and culture of the region.  The festival and parade,which is coordinated by volunteers, is a three-day festival includes musical entertainment of all varieties,children?s group performances, dance, oration national recording artists, food, bargains, and plenty of fun.  The East Madison Mardi Gras       In the late 50s and 60s the East Madison-East Union Commercial Club proudly sponsored the East Madison Mardi Gras Festival and Parade. Before the Mardi Gras, the African American community participated in the International Festival.  The International Festival was held in what was once known as Chinatown. Chinatown is currently referred to as the impact of the International Festival. The international Festival was the first neighborhood event to agree to hold its festivities as an integral part of the Seattle SEAFAIR celebration. Four different cultures combined to stage the event: Filipino, Black (then Negro), Chinese, and Japanese. Each selected their own Queen and her court of four princesses to reign over her community and ride in the Parade on that community?s float. In addition to riding in the Parade through Chinatown, the Festival Queens and their courts rode in the Capital Hill Parades, Rainier Valley Parade, the University District Kiddies Parade and the SEAFAIR Grande Parade.  City officials estimated that nearly 200,000 people jammed their way into over crowded Chinatown Second Annual International Festival where the rich and out-of-other-side-of-towners and community natives elbowed one another for a glimpse at the Chinese dragon dancers, or the lovely Queens and their courts on their respective floats.  Long lines of people made their way through the streets from one food booth to another while others waited in lengthy lines of Chinatown restaurants. Asian dancers and style shows entertained for hours. As if that weren?t enough to put one into a frenzy, live bands such as Bob Marshalls jazzed up the night while torch songs rang out dwarfing the whistles of the incoming trains.  One man was rumored to have said, ?This festival business had a flavor of the bootlegging days when Chinatown pulsated with Ragtime music and the rich slipped away from the usual boredom to swing and enjoy.?  The International Festival?s second year didn?t surpass its first because of the enormous turnout. The city had to break it up. This is when the four communities decided to put on their own festivals. From the move toward individual festivals, the East Madison East Union Mardi Gras Festival was born.  With the end of Mardi Gras in the 60s, various business and community leaders, including Pacific Northwest Bell, Central Area Motivation Program and the Pacific Northwest Black Community Association would carry the torch. Since 1997, the Umoja Fest African Heritage Festival & Parade has preserved the festival spirit and will continue to grow.",,PO Box 22328,98122.0,,,

When the more than 50 replies she received were from individuals as desperate as she to find encouraging news about MS, Lawry realized the need for an organized effort to stimulate and finance research into the cure, treatment, and cause of multiple sclerosis.  The result was that on March 11, 1946, Lawry gathered 20 of the nation's most prominent research scientists and founded what would become the National MS Society.

1.0245117036E10,Bike Works,BIKE WORKS,,http://www.bikeworks.org,Our mission:   To build sustainable communities by educating youth and promoting bicycling.,"1. YOUTH EDUCATION: EARN A BIKE: Kids, Bikes, & Sweat Equity In our signature Earn-A-Bike program, kids build skills and self-confidence as they work with their hands and learn how to repair bikes. They also experience what it means to give back to their community, as they contribute community service hours refurbishing bikes which are donated to local nonprofits. After logging 18 hours of community service, kids earn their own bikes and build them with their own hands!  In 2008, we offered six EAB classes ? two per school quarter. Our classroom is at maximum capacity with ten students, making our total EAB participation 67 youth in 2008. Sixty-one percent of those youth earned their own bikes, along with locks and, of course, helmets! YOUTH VENTURES: Ride It Like You Earned It! Our Youth Ventures program keeps youth from our Earn-A-Bike and partnership classes engaged in bicycling. It is not enough to help kids earn bikes and learn to fix them; without support and a riding partner, it is difficult to make cycling a part of their regular activities. In 2008, our Youth Ventures program (code-name ?Street Burners? for the youth) engaged 501 youth in 86 activities - including neighborhood rides, safety rodeos, field trips to community and cycling events, mountain biking, BMX trick riding, and track racing. Our tag-line ?Ride It Like You Earned It!? captures the spirit of this program.  SUMMER TOURING CAMPS: In 2008 Bike Works offered five summer riding camps, including three self-supported bicycle touring camps. We developed these programs to give our youth participants the opportunity to experience the natural environment of the Pacific Northwest, and to encourage bicycling as an alternative and fun means of transportation. COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS: Many youth in the neighborhoods we serve don?t have opportunities to become involved in after-school activities, and can?t attend our regular EAB classes. Our Community Partnerships program connects us with schools and community organizations to reach youth underserved by after-school opportunities.   2. COMMUNITY BIKE SHOP: Each and every bicycle donated, refurbished, and recycled back into the community is one less bike in the landfill, and potentially one less car on the road.  Our bike shop sells affordable, refurbished bicycles, and runs entirely on bikes donated from people just like you! One hundred percent of income raised in our shop goes to support youth programming - accounting for over 50% of our annual operating revenue.   3. BICYCLE DISTRIBUTION & EXPORTS: A great deal of our resources and time is dedicated to returning defunct bicycles to the streets of Seattle. After a bicycle is fixed up by an Earn-A-Bike student or a volunteer, it may be repatriated to the community in a number of different ways. FareStart, a restaurant jobs-training program that helps homeless adults turn their lives around, receives Bike Works bikes for each graduate. Additionally, we donate extensively to Treehouse, a resource center for foster families. In 2007, we recycled 250 bikes back into the community, donated 138 bikes to local nonprofit organizations, distributed 162 bikes to youth through our programs and annual Kids Bike Swap, sent 1,410 bicycles to villages in Ghana, and recycled many tons of scrap metal!",,(206) 725-9408,3709 S.

These housing developments have not only helped thousands of low-income families and individuals but have had an economic impact on the region in construction activity and revenue.","LIHI is rooted in a commitment to advocacy for low-income and homeless people.  LIHI's early emphases were providing advocacy and technical assistance to promote the interests of low-income and homeless people.  LIHI worked to support the efforts of homeless individuals who established an emergency shelter in a 'bus barn' at the Seattle Center in 1990.  The result of this effort was the development of the 57-unit Aloha Inn, the first self-managed transitional housing program in the country for homeless people. This was followed shortly after by the Arion Court, which provides 37 units of permanent self-managed housing for homeless people.  The Aloha Inn and Arion Court were, at their inception, innovative concepts for implementing democratic decision-making and self-governance among traditionally disenfranchised populations.  Principles of mutual housing, or self-management, now guide 20 of LIHI's 48 properties--equipping residents with opportunities for meaningful decision-making and shared responsibility for the management of their housing.    The incorporation of LIHI as an organization resulted from the leadership of three founding board members: Frank Chopp of the Fremont Public Association, Michael Reichert of Catholic Community Services, and Scott Morrow of SHARE.  LIHI filled a void in the community for creating self-managed communities and developing innovative housing solutions.

Speculative fiction (science fiction, fantasy, horror, magic realism and slipstream) gives voice to those who explore societal and technological change along with deeper considerations of underlying archetypes of human experience. Clarion West brings new writers to the field of speculative fiction by providing a venue for a transformative experience in the form of a lengthy and intensive workshop focusing on literary quality, diversity of viewpoints, range of material, and other essential traits.  Clarion West is a nonprofit literary organization and is committed to equal opportunity. Although there are fine science fiction and fantasy writers of all ethnicities, races, and genders, historically the field has reflected the same prejudices found in the culture around it, leading to proportionally fewer successful writers of color and women writers than white male writers. Within the limitations of the workshop, Clarion West is dedicated to improving those proportions.  As an extension of its primary mission, Clarion West seeks to make speculative fiction available to the public, and thus holds readings and other events that bring speculative fiction writers and readers together.","Clarion West is a six-week long summer workshop held in Seattle for writers preparing for a professional career in science fiction and fantasy. We recruit a total of 18 students for each year's workshop from a pool of applicants from all over the world. These students live, write and work together in an atmosphere that is both exhilarating and exhausting. We bring in a well-known writer each week to teach and week 5 of the workshop is typically taught by a well-known editor from the field. Our students have ranged in age from 18-65.   The board of directors is a group of diverse, professional people, many of whom are graduates of the workshop and now well-known writers in our genres. We also have a consultant, a banker, a CPA and an attorney among our board. The board also includes our Executive Director and Assistant Workshop Administrator as ex officio members.   We have a core group of about 20 key volunteers working in communications, fundraising, event planning, outreach and membership.","Clarion West was established in 1984 and in 2008 we celebrated our 25th consecutive workshop. We run public readings in partnership with the Science Fiction Museum and University Bookstore during the summer when each teacher/writer is in town.

In 2009 we received challenge grants from Amazon $25,000) and SF3 ($2500).

We work to educate and inspire people to become engaged with sustainable ecosystem management.","The Washington Park Arboretum was established in 1934 by an agreement approved by both the University of Washington (Board of Regents) and the City of Seattle (City Council/Mayor). The City of Seattle held title to a 200+ acre park known as Washington Park located in a central portion of the city. It agreed that the University could design, construct, plant, and manage an Arboretum and Botanical Garden in this park. The Arboretum Foundation was founded in 1935 and has been an active support group ever since.  In 1936, the Seattle Garden Club donated $3000 to hire James F. Dawson and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. of the Olmsted Brothers landscape firm to design the first planting plan. Mr. Dawson was the chief designer of the plan. During those early years when the nation was in deep depression, 500 men in the Public Works Administration constructed many of the historical features; e.g., the Stone Cottage, and Azalea Way. The Dawson plan followed the typical phylogenetic progression of families from primitive to advanced, as accepted in that day.  However, the majority of the accessions to the collections occurred during the years after World War II, when the late Brian O. Mulligan was director. His modifications to the original design led to many plants being culturally better sited, and gardens, such as the Winter and Woodland Gardens, with an emphasis on design focus.  During the 1970's, disagreements arose regarding the roles and interests of the University, the City, and the Arboretum's immediate neighborhood. As a result, the University and City negotiated a more detailed working partnership, summarized in 1974 in a Letter of Clarification to the 1934 Agreement. In 1980, the University reaffirmed its managerial role by establishing the Center for Urban Horticulture (CUH) at Union Bay, at a campus site only 1.5 miles from the Arboretum. Establishment of the Center, to provide physical facilities, programs, and staff that could not be accommodated within the Arboretum grounds, was essential to fulfilling its larger mission, and was mandated by the 1978 Master Plan Update. Today, the Arboretum is managed in association with the Center for Urban Horticulture which has continued to clarify and expand the Arboretum's aims and programs.  In the late 1980's, discussion intensified about the future of the Arboretum itself, including the need for a new strategic Master Plan. A new collections policy had been enacted, the educational and interpretation programs were greatly expanded, new facilities at both the Union Bay and Arboretum sites had been constructed, and the use of the plant collections by the University and other area educational institutions had greatly increased. The age of the collections, the location within an affluent urban area and the need for diversification of public programs were key elements for future planning.",(206) 543-8616,3501 NE 41st St.,98105.0,-122.29019,47.65806,"(47.65806, -122.29019)"

Our council's key programs are Small Group (4-8 youth led by two or more adult volunteers), Community Family Club (families meet on a month basis for dinner and then break into age groups for program), Resident Camp (Camp Sealth is located on Vashon Island and operates summer resident camp for 2,000 youth and can be rented by other non-profit groups during other times of year), Day Camp (11 one-week camps at various parks), 2 licensed childcare centers, Youth Volunteer Corps (planned and supervised community service opportunities for youth 11-18), Special Sitters training (train youth 13 - 18 to work with children with special needs) and Special Saturday Club (a respite program for children with special needs and their siblings on scheduled Saturdays in 3 locations).

We rely heavily on volunteers to bring programs and services to youth.","Camp Fire was started as Camp Fire Girls in 1910 in Maine by Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick and Charlotte Vetter Gulick.  The first Camp Fire groups started in Kirkland and Federal Way in 1911.  In 1975 Camp Fire Girls started to admit boys and our name changed to Camp Fire Boys and Girls.  In 2001 we officially became Camp Fire USA.  Camp Fire purchased Camp Sealth on Vashon Island in 1921.  The camp contains 400 acres and nearly 1.5 miles of beach front.  Our camp operates year round.  In the summer we have children from all over the world stay for 4 - 15 days, depending on the program they choose.  The rest of the year it is available to non-profit organizations for events and retreats.  The Seattle council merged with the Kit-No-Ma Council from Bremerton in 1992.  We now operate a second camp property (Camp Niwana) in Port Orchard, WA.  This camp is more primitive and is used by Camp Fire and community groups in the Kitsap peninsula area.  The Central Puget Sound Council created two programs in the 1990's, Special Sitters and Special Saturday Club, that are now used in councils across the USA.  The latest addition to the Camp Fire program family is Community Family Club.  It is an alternative to the traditional small group and the focus is the entire family.  A group of families meet usually once or twice per month.  Activities are planned by parents and duties are rotated to give everyone a chance to be involved.  Families share a dinner, divide children into age groups for fun activities then come together for a closing ceremony.",,"4241 21st Ave W, Suite 200",98199.0,-122.38382,47.65881,"(47.65881, -122.38382)"

Hamlin always hoped for an elementary school which could serve as a model of Slingerland instruction.  In 1983 the Board of Directors of the Slingerland Institute, under the leadership of Dr. Winston Addis and Lee Lewis, acquired space in a surplus elementary school on Mercer Island and the school became a reality. Hamlin?s widow, Mary Helen Robinson-Wells, a psychologist, trained Orton-Gillingham teacher and pioneer in the field of dyslexia, was an active member of the Hamlin Robinson School Board until her death in 2002.  The Robinson family, Addis family, and Lewis family continue to support the school by serving on the HRS Board of Trustees.  Dr. Deborah Davis and Clara McCulloch were teaching directors during those first three years on Mercer Island.  In the spring of the school?s third year, Beverly Wolf, Dean of the Slingerland Institute, was appointed as half-time director of the school.  By the fall of 1986 the school was in a position to operate independently.  Bev became a full-time Director and the school, in a friendly split from the Slingerland Institute, was spun off legally and financially but retained a close professional relationship with the Institute.  The Board leased space from the Bellevue School District and the school continued to grow and flourish for the next four years at this location.  During that time HRS held its first auction, received its first grant, and became a Slingerland summer school location for both teachers and dyslexic students.  The school moved to its current location in Seattle in the summer of 1990.  The school was awarded the Medina Foundation Management Excellence Award that same year and was accredited by the Pacific Northwest Association of Independent Schools (PNAIS) in 1991 and reaccredited in 1998.

We work to end poverty and racism in both our educational and community work by providing outstanding early education to the children in our program, by advocating for community support for access to quality care for all families, and by developing curriculum materials that are culturally relevant and meaningful to children.","Our NAEYC accredited program serves about 75 families each year on a sliding scale.  Since over 70% of the families we serve earn low to moderate incomes, we are, for many of our families, the only option for affordable care required for families to earn a living, attend school or otherwise achieve their goals.  We don't charge the full cost of care for any of our families, since quality care costs more than the current market-rates will support.  To do this, we fund raise over half of our operating costs from individual, corporate and foundation donors.  Quality care requires dedicated and skilled teachers, who stay long enough to establish lasting relationships.  That's one reason why our costs exceed market-rates - we pay our teachers more than the prevailing wages to attract and retain great teachers.  We provide full medical benefits and place a premium on providing excellent working conditions.  Many of our teachers have worked at the preschool for over 5-10 years.  Our turnover rate is far below the national average for child care - something that we're quite proud of.  We also keep children and teachers together for most of the time that they are in the program - children and teachers move from classroom to classroom together as the children grow older.  This is in contrast to programs have new teachers for each year of care - moving children through 3-4 classes between their third and fifth birthdays.  We also serve over 30,000 meals and snacks to the children in our care - providing 70% of the daily nutritional requirements for our children.  Many of the ingredients served are Market-fresh, and all are healthy and nutritious.  We're committed to a healthy, vegetable-rich menu.  Almost all of our meals are homemade from scratch, prepared by our nutritionist who has prepared meals on site for over 15 years.  Finally, we are leaders in the community.  We work to advocate for an end to poverty and all other forms of oppression.  We stand up for worthy wages for all child care workers.  We advocate for more support for early childhood care and education - so that all families can afford quality care for their children.  We provide trainings, help communities get together to share ideas, and develop curriculum for culturally relevant care and education for young children.","Pike Market Child Care and Preschool is a dream come true for the Pike Place Market community.

We work with the State Parks to enhance the 125 parks within the State and to establish mechanisms to sustain this work for the future.  The Foundation has four key elements in our plan to improve the State parks:  ? We are educating Washington residents on critical environmental threats to habitat in our land and marine parks;  ? We are establishing interpretive centers and environmental education curriculum to help our State?s families and children understand natural processes;  ? We are sponsoring trail projects to enhance the recreational enjoyment of those who use our parks; and  ?

The primary obligation of this representation is to independently investigate the circumstances of the children and to formulate recommendations for an appropriate placement and service plan for the present situation as well as long-term.,The Dependency CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) program is established and operates under the authority of the King County Superior Court.,"The Dependency CASA Program, formally known as the Guardian ad Litem Program was started in 1977, in the Juvenile Division of King County Superior Court.  The program reflects the vision and experience of the now retired Honorable David W. Soukup and the direction of the former Program Manager Carmen Ray-Bettineski. Judge Soukup, who served for 14 years as a King County Superior Court judge, was experienced, in both Juvenile Court and Family law.  From this experience, he believed that children, unlike adults, often did not have effective representation in judicial proceedings.  He concluded ""... children's needs were not being adequately represented to the court."" To address this problem in dependency proceedings, Judge Soukup envisioned a program of trained volunteers who would become directly involved in the legal system for the purpose of investigating and advocating on behalf of children, alleged to be abused and/or neglected.  These volunteers would ensure that the court would have confidential ""eyes and ears"" for each child. One hundred community volunteers became active during the first year of the program's operation.  They implemented Judge Soukup's vision with such success that the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges recognized the format of the Seattle program as a national model.   In 1979, the Council's Children in Placement Committee coined the phrase Court Appointed Special Advocate, or CASA for short, as a comprehensive method of designating trained volunteers serving as Guardians ad Litem.  As many court jurisdictions throughout the country began adopting the Seattle model, a National Court Appointed Special Advocate Association was formed in 1981, with Carmen Ray-Bettineski serving as president. In 1983, a non-profit corporation, Friends of the Guardain ad Litem Program, was formed to accept donations and grants to assist GALs in advocating for abused and neglected children. The CASA Program, which provided volunteer advocates to children who were subjects of custody and visitation disputes, received wide acclaim and was founded by King County as a separate program in 1985.  On June 1, 1999, the Guardian ad Litem Program announced its intention to become known as the Dependency CASA Program.  This name change took place because there has been increasing confusion, for a number of years, regarding the work of volunteer GALs and paid GALs.  During this transition ""CASA/GAL"" will be used in many instances to designate volunteers in Dependency Court. Today, the Dependency CASA Program, under the leadership of Program Manager Linda Katz, has approximately 380 volunteers who serve the court in 1500 cases each year.  The volunteers are supported by a professional staff, which in addition to the Program Manager includes Assistant managers, legal council, legal assistants, and secretarial personnel. A number of private law firms provide volunteer (pro bono) attorneys to represent CASAs at trials.  The three firms who fund this service are Davis, Wright, Todd, Riese, and Jones; Perkins, Coie, Stone, Olsen, and Williams; and Bogle and Gates. The quality advocacy that the CASAs of King County have established for representing abused and neglected children has set high standards for CASA Programs across the country.

We create environments that build leadership, deepen shared values, and shift culture so that groups and organizations can better achieve the goals they seek.  The Center works across sectors with business, government, nonprofit, education and community groups. Founded in 1991, we are best known for our work in:  VALUES We help people claim their core values and put them into action. For organizations, this typically involves three conversations to make explicit: the values individuals bring to work; the shared values of the group; and the values that define the organization?s relationship to the common good.  ETHICAL LEADERSHIP Ethics is intended to promote behavior directed toward the greater good. There is often a gap between the way things should be and the way they are. Leaders step into these gaps and make changes that align behavior with values. The Center?s 4-V model of ethical leadership has been used extensively to create cultures of integrity.   GRACIOUS SPACE We create the space for people to have conversations that matter. This involves creating a safe, respectful setting where diverse perspectives are welcome and people discover solutions together. We teach people to hold challenging conversations in a productive way.  MAKING CHANGE Some people seek to manage change. We help people intentionally make the changes that matter most to them. The Center utilizes comprehensive change models that align individual behavior, group cultures and organizational systems and structures.   All of these approaches help people transform individually, form new relationships and work together in new ways. The typical result is people sharing their gifts and talents more fully to move the organization?s work forward.","The Center for Ethical Leadership was founded in 1991 by Bill Grace, PhD. Since its inception it has been a place where individuals, organizations and community groups could turn to for support in learning to live their core values into all aspects of their lives.  Over the years we've offered various programs and workshops targeting different populations and sharing our latest learning about cutting edge leadership tools.  In 2005 the founder stepped down, and passed the Executive Director torch to Dale Nienow, PhD.

Leveraging our collective expertise and resources, we partner with and strengthen promising nonprofits for maximum community impact.  SVP's mission is advance the common good by engaging and connecting a community of philanthropic leaders, strengthening local nonprofits, and catalyzing efforts to accelerate system change.","Our Model: SVP works much the way venture capital does, by investing both time and expertise in a multi-year partnership.  POOLED FUNDS SUPPORT INVESTEES AND SVP SEATTLE: SVP Partners join SVP by making an annual contribution of $5,700 or more. The funds are pooled and used to provide grants to Investees (grant recipients) and support SVP?s programs and operations. Grant funds are used for general operating support and capacity-building projects.  WE COLLABORATE WITH OUR INVESTEES: We bring our collective expertise to promising nonprofit organizations, collaborating with them to positively impact our community. Investees are selected through a committee of 10?12 SVP Partners. Once selected, SVP works in concert with the organization to improve upon their ability to deliver effective programs.  WE STRENGTHEN THE ORGANIZATION AS A WHOLE: Building upon the programmatic expertise of the Investee, SVP helps the organization strengthen its management practices, strategies and systems. With access to skilled volunteers, professional consultants and management training opportunities, Investees can improve the following:   - Board Development and Governance    - Leadership Development    - Program Evaluation and Performance Management   - Financial Management    - Fund Development    - Information Technology    - Marketing, PR and Communications    - Human Resources    - Strategic Planning    - Legal   The SVP Organizational Capacity-Building Tool helps Investees evaluate, plan and prioritize how they will strengthen their organization.  AN INTENSE MULTI-YEAR PARTNERSHIP: SVP seeks to develop true partnerships with Nonprofits. SVP?s approach is unique, and most nonprofits are not accustomed to a funder being involved with the internal operations of their organization. Once selected, a Lead Partner is assigned to work with each Investee. The Lead Partner assists the Investee in prioritizing their organizational capacity-building goals, developing their annual work plan and coordinating a team of volunteer and paid consultants. Investees participate in an annual review process to measure progress on goals, assess volunteer projects and use of SVP resources. There are generally 20 Investees working with SVP in any given year, and funding relationships with most organizations last between three and five years.","In 1997, Social Venture Partners was the inspiration of former Aldus Corporation President Paul Brainerd. Along with business leaders Scott Oki, Ida Cole, Bill Neukom and, Doug and Maggie Walker, Brainerd founded a new type of philanthropic organization, calling it Social Venture Partners. Through collaboration they believed they could make a bigger impact. The donors ? Partners ? would not only contribute financially, but would offer their time and expertise to build long-term partnerships with nonprofit organizations ? Investees.  SVP?s dual mission strives to strengthen nonprofit organizations and nurture philanthropists as engaged and effective givers. Our mission, strategic vision and core values guide us in our efforts. However, our Partners are engaged in many of the decision-making processes, including our four areas of funding: Early Childhood Development, the Environment, K?12 Education, and Out-of-School Time.  Through the many opportunities available, Partners gain a rich insight into community issues, the nonprofit sector, giving strategies, and philanthropic and civic leadership. In addition, Partners develop their knowledge of philanthropy through our Partner Education offerings, which include panels, classes and hands-on experiences.  Today, more than 420 local Partners contribute their know-how, resources and passion to more than 20 King County organizations. Learning from each other and the groups they support, Partners have provided over 75,000 hours of volunteer consulting and have granted in excess of $10 million to advance promising nonprofits.  The local accomplishments of SVP have inspired others to do the same. Now with over 20 affiliates worldwide, SVP is bringing positive social change to communities across the country and around the world.",(206) 374-8757,"Seattle Center's NW Rooms (Alki Room), 305 Harrison Street",98109.0,,,

We do this by creating an environment where nothing is off-limits for children and everything is designed to speak their language. Through our interactive programming, we ignite children's curiosity and encourage them to take the lead, helping them become active, life-long learners.","The Museum's educational programs include daily hands-on activities, arts and cultural demonstrations and interactive exhibits. We provide an ideal setting for the exploration, practice and mastery of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in mathematics, science and the creative arts. Informal education is crucial during the developmental period from birth to age 10. A baby's brain grows every day, tripling in size during the first three years of life and 90 percent of the brain's wiring is completed by age five. From this age forward, coinciding with the beginning of formal education, children learn best through first-hand experiences that can engage them in a variety of ways, capitalizing on learning strengths and bolstering others. For both very young children and those ages 5 to 10, the Museum's child-centered environment allows learning to be constructed by doing, in ways applicable to the young learner's individual experiences, in the form of purposeful play.   Play is an essential and integral part of every child's healthy growth, development and learning across all ages, domains and cultures. Play is the scaffold for learning development that has a powerful influence on later development.

The group charges itself with assessing AIDS education efforts targeted at gay and bisexual men. Men who have sex with men accounted for 90% of all new infections, but only 20% of locally distributed HIV Prevention funds were targeted toward meeting their needs. Alarmed by this inequity, the Task Force makes independent recommendations to the King County HIV/AIDS Planning Council.  1994  In January, the MSM Task Force presents ?Why Are Fags Still Fucking Without Condoms?? This public forum draws over 300 men, who speak of grief, loss, depression, survivor guilt and disconnection from the community. Men express how prevention tactics failed to address their concerns. The community sent a clear message: educators must work harder to reach those most at risk for HIV infection.   The MSM Task Force changes its name to Gay Men?s AIDS Prevention Task Force (GayMAP) and holds three more forums in 1994. Attendance grows at each forum and the voices grow stronger. Public Health Officials can no longer ignore the need for new HIV prevention strategies for gay and bisexual men.   1995  Gay City Health Project is founded in April with a grant from Public Health - Seattle & King County. Dedicated to bold, innovative programming, Gay City continues GayMAP?s provocative forums and expands to include a variety of groups, workshops and other educational and community events.   Gay City brings people together to work toward creative solutions to common problems. The frustrations expressed in previous forums become an impetus for action and change.   Gay City employs the concept of social marketing to get out its community mobilization and empowerment message. By using business sector marketing strategies, Gay City is able to engage the community like never before.   1996 The Greater Seattle Business Association recognizes Gay City as Non-Profit of the Year.   In April, Gay City starts Queercore, a program for guys under 30 that addresses the unique concerns of being the second generation of gay and bi guys affected by the AIDS epidemic. Queercore begins supporting young men with community forums, film nights, theatre productions, rap groups, games in the park and more.   In July, Gay City makes a presentation at the National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference in downtown Seattle. Health educators are rocked by the program?s design and successes, making Gay City the hit of the conference.   Gay City makes waves with it's ""Tunnel of Love"" forum.   1997 Gay City receives a three-year $500,000 grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to continue and expand its creative programming. By this time, nearly a hundred organizations throughout the world have developed programs based on the Gay City model, making Gay City part of a larger movement of holistic approaches to gay and bi men?s health.   In response to combination therapy and the success many were experiencing with new treatment options, Gay City hosts ""The End of AIDS: Hope or Hype?""   1998 Gay City makes a major impact with the launch our media campaign ""We're All In Bed Together"". The campaign seeks to raise awareness and increase community dialogue about our individual and community-wide roles in HIV and STD prevention. Gay City presents the popular community forum ""The Great Age Divide,"" initiating broad conversation about the need for cross-generational dialog.   1999 To better address the concerns and issues of first generation AIDS survivors, Gay City starts the Over 40s Project in collaboration with Seattle AIDS Support Group. The Over 40?s Project has since become a model program, initiating meaningful community discussions on sexuality, masculinity, survivor guilt, relationships, and redefining what it means to grow older in a community often focused on youth. Gay City hosts an intense conversation about power, politics and personalities with ""Who's afraid of Elizabeth Birch?""   2000 Gay City Health Project begins branching out from strictly HIV and AIDS issues in 2000. Party Smart is a media campaign designed to address substance use in the community with hard-hitting messages presented in a non-shaming and non-judgmental way. The campaign is later adopted by other groups across the country and heralded as a particularly effective and meaningful way to engage queer men about substance use. Gay City University, which provides opportunities for growth and learning through non-graded courses, wins a ""Best of Seattle"" Award from Seattle Weekly. Gay City works with Public Health in crafting an innovative Hepatitis vaccine education campaign. A year after ""Hepatitis Hurts: Get the Shots"" debuted, vaccination rates among gay men in Seattle increased by 64% for Hepatitis A, and by 10% for Hepatitis B. Gay City presents ""Pride and Prejudice"" to a packed house and initiates an intense conversation about race in the gay community.   2001 King County Tobacco Council presents their Ostrich Award for ""getting people's head out of the sand"" to Gay City's Out to Quit campaign (a collaboration with Seattle Lesbian Cancer Project). The campaign receives numerous other accolades from queer health groups across the nation. Gay City collaborates with Toys In Babeland in presenting ""Suck My Gender"", an eye-opening community forum focusing on the complexities of gender and sexuality. We fill Broadway Performance Hall with a capacity crowd of all genders and sexualities. Gay City hires Fred Swanson as our new Executive Director. Fred is one of thirteen Americans invited to participate in the International Thinktank on Gay Men's Health, an international gathering of gay men's health advocates and leaders in 2001-2002. His international experience in health promotion and community organizing sets a new tone for the organization. Gay City presents ""Fear My Love,"" a provocative discussion on HIV Status and Intimacy.   2002 Referring to us as a ""heroic local group,"" Seattle Weekly names Gay City one of Seattle's Dozen Rays of Hope in 2002, a spotlight we shared with groups such as the Children's Alliance and Washington Alliance for Immigrant and Refugee Justice. Seeking to specifically engage men who are not in the Queercore or Over 40?s Project demographics, Gay City initiates Crew, an all-ages volunteer group committed to creating community building and health initiatives. Some of the first programming includes Yoga and CookBoys. Gay City collaborates with The Northwest Network in presenting ""Domestic Disturbance"", a groundbreaking community forum about male-on-male domestic violence. It is the best attended event of its kind in Seattle history.   2003 A new www.gaycity.org is launched. Gay City brings then Executive Director of the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force Lorri L. Jean to speak on the current and future state of queer activism. Gay City produces ACTION: a handy STD guide for gay, bi & trans men, also making it available online. Emphasizing accessible HIV/STD information, Gay City creates 206.267.STUD, a 24-hour STD info line. Gay City brings over 400 community members and allies together, along with 17 partner organizations, in a series of three public forums about HIV and STD rates among gay and bisexual men in King County.

PCAP supports mothers in achieving this goal by helping them complete substance abuse treatment and stay in recovery and by motivating them to choose effective family planning methods. The goals of the program are to (1) assist mothers in obtaining treatment, maintaining recovery, and resolving the complex problems associated with their substance abuse; (2) guarantee that the children are in a safe environment and receiving appropriate health care; (3) effectively link families with community resources; and (4) demonstrate successful strategies for working with this population to prevent the risk of future drug- and alcohol-affected children.","Perinatal Treatment Services was originally founded as a research demonstration project through NIDA (National Institute of Drug Abuse) from 1989 ? 1994.  The MOMS project was an interdisciplinary approach to providing recovery services to pregnant, chemically dependent women that incorporated the strength of field work with research clinical trials.

Her children, Ricky and Barbara, were 3 and 5 at the time. She knew that she and her children needed a tremendous amount of support and she pictured a place where her children and she could go, be comforted and supported; a place they could return to again and again as they learned how to live their new life - a place where grief was welcomed and shared. She began to picture a big old house with a fireplace, a pot of tea, candles, warmth. A place where people could share comfort, friendship, laughter and tears. She and her children attended support groups in Tiburon at The Center for Attitudinal Healing. She felt that those groups and the counselor she saw at the time saved her life.  Two years later, she and her family moved from the Bay Area to Seattle. She met three other people who had been widowed young; Joel Junker, Katie Evans and Barbara Hendricks. Together, they started support groups, officially known as Widowed Young Persons Support.  Kath continued to envision an actual place where families could come to get support. During this time she was working at Group Health Hospice as the bereavement coordinator. It was there that she met Jill Jacox Tan, who was interested in her vision. Finally, I had met someone of like mind, who pictured a place where people could come, get support, meet others who were going through similar struggles.  Jill had a great deal of experience with children and grief. Until recently, she served as our Children's Program Coordinator, and is currently a member of our Advisory Board.  In September of 2000 The Healing Center became a non-profit organization with 501 c 3 status. The dream had been realized. For five years, The Healing Center offered programs for adults, children and families in rented and donated space at several locations as the programs grew. In August of 2005, Ann Sparling White joined our staff. Ann has many years of experience working with bereaved individuals, children and families, and heads our school outreach program.  In December of 2005 The Healing Center was able to rent a home in the Ravenna neighborhood of Seattle. At long last, all of our programs are under one roof.  The Healing Center's goal is to support children, adults and families as they come to terms with the death of a loved one. We offer a variety of services and a community of people. This is a place where bereaved people, adults and children alike, can stop for a little while, rest, be comforted, meet others who understand and begin to move through their grief so that, ultimately, they can begin to make peace with death and rebuild their lives. The long-term goal is that each person will come to a place of peace and will find new meaning as they reinvest in life.

Our nationally recognized programs and activities impact children in three essential ways:  Academic success?Improving grades, reducing high school drop-out rates, and teaching kids to see themselves as learners.

Please call a Club near you to find out more about the programs offered there.","Rotary Boys and Girls Club began as the Rotary Youth Foundation in 1939, and was established by the Rotary Service Club of Seattle for the purpose of building character in Seattle?s young boys.  The Foundation was operated in the basement of the Plymouth Congregational Church and was known as the George Coleman Club House.  In 1947, the club became affiliated with the Boys Clubs of America.  Within a single year, 500 boys had become members.  At that time, programs centered around three core areas as follows: Physical Recreation (sports), Vocational Recreation (woodworking, metal and leather crafts), and Social Recreation (games, music and special events).     By 1953, the club had become so popular that the membership had outgrown the church facilities.  Extensive research indicated that the Rotary Boys Club would better serve the community if it were centrally located in the area of greatest need.  Therefore, in 1954, the Rotary Club of Seattle contracted W.G. Clark Construction Company, owned by Don L. Clark, to build the existing facility.   At the time of its construction, with its state of the art tilt up concrete design, the Rotary Boys and Girls was considered the most modern Club in the Pacific Northwest.  It was designed to accommodate a membership of 1,500 youths.   During the 1977-78, academic year, the Boys Club began to admit girls.  The first female member at Rotary was Joyce Walker, who went to set numerous state prep scoring records, while leading Garfield Bulldogs Girls Basketball teams to the state title.  Joyce went on to earn All-American honors at Louisiana State University (LSU), and became only the second woman in history to become a member of the legendary Harlem Globetrotters basketball team.    Now, more than 40 years later, the Rotary Boys and Girls Club continues to serve the central area community.  The Rotary Club of Seattle spearheaded a new addition to the building in 1989.  Its purpose was to house the newly created Rotary Educational Assistance Program (REAP).  REAP is a comprehensive educational support program that provides tutors and mentors for the youths in our community.  REAP was developed in conjunction with the Seattle Public Schools, and provides an environment where students can improve grades, build self esteem, and enhance their ability to succeed in our society.

Adhering to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards (NCTM) and Washington State's Essential Academic Learning Requirements (EALRs), we strive to help students enjoy the process of mathematics.  Goals Our goals are specific: 1.Create confidence and excitement for math in young children. 2.Start early in the educational lives of children. 3.Involve the entire school community, including teachers and parents.  We have a five pronged strategy: 1.Create high quality programs that adhere to state and national educational standards.  2.Work inside and outside of the classroom 3.Offer a variety of fun and interesting out-of-class activities. 4.Create confident teachers of mathematics 5.Build programs that can be sustained within a school over the long term.  EIM Programs ?Math Clubs: Provide an opportunity for students to practice their math skills and conceptual knowledge in a fun, non-intimidating environment. ?Monthly Math Bulletin Boards: Rally the entire school community together to work on different mathematical challenges each month, which are displayed on an artistically designed bulletin board provided by EIM.  ?Family Math Game Nights: Bring families, students, teachers and administrators together one night per quarter to play math games, teach parents how to engage in fun math activities at home, and have a great time.  ?Summer Math Camp: Minimize the learning loss that students experience over the long summer break by offering fun and engaging two-week long summer day camps focused solely on math. Topics such as Exploring Art and Architecture and History of Numbers are offered annually. ?Mathematician in Residence: Help teachers build their confidence in math and their repertoire of fun and educational math activities by providing an expert math coach in the school a few hours each week to work directly with teachers in their classrooms.","Explorations in Math was founded as an organization in February 2003, however, the organization remained under the fiscal sponsorship of Powerful Schools until February 2007, when it applied for and gained its own 501c3 non-profit status.  The organization found its beginnings in a Lake Washington School District school in which the PTA sponsored math programs in two Seattle schools.  Word of mouth spread and the number of schools served grew 100% year-over-year for the next several years out of the need for more, high quality math education programs within elementary schools, especially in economically disadvantaged communities. EIM?s experience of core competencies began with chess and after school math clubs which eventually grew to include staff development, community challenge boards, family math nights, a Mathematician-in-Residence program and consulting.  From the beginning, the goal of the programs has been to engage the entire school community of students, teachers, parents and administrators to create a math culture that would sustain math achievement.  Some of the landmarks by which EIM is known is its ability to galvanize schools around mathematics in order to build a math culture.  Some key moments of inspiration are when teachers say, ?I want to teach math like Explorations in Math does,? to students who come to school asking if it is math club day, to parents asking for more information on how to help their children at home with math, to a gymnasium full of students, on the hottest day of the year, playing math for hours on end.

For over 35 years, ICHS has provided culturally-appropriate and multilingual care to improve the health of our community.  Services include prevention, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illness and minor injuries; nutritional and health education; mental health counseling; Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Food Voucher Program; Family Planning Services; and Chinese traditional medicine.  ICHS grew from a small storefront clinic in Seattle?s International District into the largest Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community health center in Washington state.","In the early 1970s, low-income Asian immigrants in the International District had few options when they needed to see a doctor who spoke their language. At the time, the only community clinic in the area was the Pioneer Square Neighborhood Health Station, which was too far for most elderly Chinese and Filipinos to reach by foot.   With the construction of I-5 in the 1960s and the Kingdome in the 1970s threatening to uproot homes and businesses in the area, the International District (ID) seemed like an unlikely place to launch a medical practice. But in 1973, a group of dedicated community advocates, including Heide Parreño, Bruce Miyahara, Bob Santos, and a host of others?began their struggle to bring culturally appropriate medical services to the neighborhood.   Dr. Eugene Ko, owner and manager of the Jefferson Park Clinic in Beacon Hill, donated space for the advocates to establish the Asian Community Health Clinic, which would provide basic in-language health care to mainly elderly Chinese and Filipino patients in Beacon Hill and the surrounding neighborhoods. Volunteer doctors, interpreters, and mental health staff operated the Asian Community Health Clinic out of the Jefferson Park Clinic on Tuesday nights, and eventually on Saturday mornings.   In 1975, the Asian Community Health Clinic moved to its own location in the International District, and the International District (ID) Community Health Center was born. The ID Clinic, as it is still popularly known, was the first of its kind in the nation to serve a diverse Asian population at one site.   In 1996, the Board of Directors and staff decided to expand the scope of the ID Clinic?s services beyond the International District, to South Seattle. The clinic changed its name to International Community Health Services (ICHS), to reflect the addition of a second clinic location, the Holly Park Medical & Dental Clinic, and to reflect the increasing diversity of the patients being served.   The Holly Park site quickly drew a large client base. By 2003, ICHS realized the need to relocate to a larger facility to accommodate the growing number of patients. The construction of light rail forced an earlier move for the clinic. On January 10, 2005, ICHS opened the doors to its new Holly Park Medical & Dental Clinic on South Othello Street, just blocks away from the old location.

The 4C Coalition was founded in 1999 when several clergy, community leaders and members here in Seattle began to take a closer look at the number of youth of color in the juvenile justice system.  Based on their findings, the group decided to take action and form an organization that would recruit community members to serve as mentors for the many at-risk youth who are dying daily in our streets and falling through the cracks in our educational system.   The 4C Coalition Mentoring Program is a 501(c) (3) agency founded specifically to engage and meet an urgent need to provide vulnerable youth with mentors to help them succeed.

The purpose of Operation Uplift was to create and design a recruitment campaign to increase and expand opportunities for mentoring.  The campaign for Operation Uplift was a collaboration between Big Brothers and Big Sisters of King County, The Joy Initiative and Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration Mentor Program.    The programs worked together to recruit mentors, especially African-American male mentors, to work with the devastating number of youth in need of support.  After several meetings it was decided by Operation Uplift that to have an impact on the faith community, an atmosphere had to be created that would inform and inspire the church community. Out of Operation Uplift the 4C Coalition was born.   SEATTLE CARES MENTORING MOVEMENT In March 2008, the 4C Coalition Mentor Program helped launch the Seattle CARES Mentoring Movement, part of a national movement spearheaded by Susan Taylor, editor emeritus of Essence Magazine.

1.0341284513E10,Freedom Project,FREEDOM PROJECT,,http://www.freedom-project.org,"Freedom Project takes Nonviolent Communication training in to four Washington State prisons, and then offers support to those returning to the community after incarceration.","The core of the Freedom Project training and curriculum is formed by a set of practices known as Nonviolent Communication (NVC) and mindfulness.   NVC is a highly respected language of compassion and educational tool developed by a clinical psychologist, Dr. Marshall Rosenberg, during the civil rights movement.  NVC, now taught in over 70 countries, shares common philosophical ground with the teachings of great leaders such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.  NVC allows people to communicate with others in a positive, effective, compassionate and peaceful manner.  Mindfulness is the practice of becoming intentionally aware of one?s thoughts, feelings, sensations, and actions in the present moment, non-judgmentally.  It promotes living in a state of being awake and in harmony with oneself and the world, and it cultivates deep appreciation for the fullness of each moment we are alive.  Mindfulness is attracting increasing interest among western psychiatrists and researchers as a non-pharmacological means of dealing with anxiety and depressive mood states.   Those who have completed NVC and mindfulness training learn to think as part of a community, and they learn to focus and to clearly express observations, feelings, and needs in a way that promotes peaceful interaction with others.  They can even learn to examine and address the root issues leading to self-destructive and addictive behaviors.","It was in 1998 that Marshall Rosenberg visited the Monroe Correctional Complex in Washington State and met Rusty Thomas, an inmate at the time. It was Rusty who was taken with his message and realized the tremendous potential for improving his own life and those of others around him.  Over the next several years, Rusty worked on building a program with Lucy Leu, a graduate of Swarthmore and Harvard and also an experienced educator and practitioner of Nonviolent Communication.  On Martin Luther King, Jr. day in 2001, Freedom Project was officially launched. This is the reason why our highest volunteer award is named from Dr. King.    Given the obvious and enormous need for training in positive, productive human relationship skills and the lack of alternatives, it soon became clear that Freedom Project?s early participants had discovered something of immense potential value.  Over the next three years, Freedom Project expanded into a larger but still informal collaboration between prisoners and leaders in the community recognizing the need for the program. In 2004, the Freedom Project?s founders decided to move the program to a more formalized non-profit model, one that would allow it to expand.  By 2006 we attained tax-exempt non-profit status, hired an executive director, finalized some of our training programs and were approaching a fully-realized and complete model.  As of 2009, Freedom Project trainers reach incarcerated men and women at four Washington State prisons. Antioch University completed a two year study of the effects of Nonviolent Communication training on prisoners, and the evidence clearly shows that what we do reduces recidivism and violence in our communities.",(206) 325-5678,PO Box 22021,98122.0,,,

Many of our students have been homeless; others are immigrants, foster youth, or single parents. What they all share in common is a strong motivation to complete their educations, coupled with a lack of adequate resources to achieve their goals. We provide our students with the financial and social resources they need to excel academically, as well as personalized, compassionate, respectful academic advising and advocacy. As a result, our students are succeeding in college and leaving poverty behind, preparing to give back to society as professionals and leaders of the next generation.  Since 2002 SEA has provided higher education advocacy and opportunity to people struggling to overcome poverty and adversity. We provide marginalized, high-potential youth and young adults with the resources they need to transition successfully to college, so that they can finish their educations and contribute to society in professional careers. Our outreach is focused on youth and young adults whose academic progress has been derailed by homelessness, trauma, and poverty.   Our students face significant barriers to college success: lack of housing, family support, money for tuition, books and food, and mentors and tutors whom they can trust. They also suffer from low societal expectations and support. By removing these barriers, we open up the world of academic and career opportunities to our young students ? the same opportunities that are available to youth from wealthier families.    Through our College Success Program, we provide free academic advising, career counseling, scholarships, tutoring, and advocacy. Now in its seventh year of service, our College Success Program has a proven track record of helping marginalized youth succeed in college. We are responding to an urgent and critical need with a bold new approach that is unduplicated in Washington State. Our staff works with students to create an individualized academic achievement plan tailored to each student's gifts and goals. We teach our students how to navigate the educational system, get federal financial aid, compete for private scholarships, make a budget, register for classes, pick the right campus and degree program, and effectively access campus services. We provide long term social support, cheering the student on toward graduation. We also operate our own scholarship fund that supplements their financial aid package.","In 2000, founder Polly Trout transitioned from teaching at San Diego State University to volunteering with homeless youth in Seattle?s University District.

Participants are generally low-income youth of color, as YMI works primarily in South Seattle communities and seeks to accurately serve and represent the communities in which it operates. YMI partners with several area organizations who provide technical trainers to teach youth the technical skills of how to use a video camera, storyboarding, digital photography computer software, media concepts, etc. The technical media skills are taught against a backdrop of media justice and anti-oppression training so that youth may acquire perspective and view media as more than simply a form of entertainment, but as a powerful tool to address issues in their communities.","The Youth Media Institute is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2004 as a summer youth program in the White Center community just south of Seattle, Washington. YMI was founded by Sharon Maeda, who is a longtime community media and social justice activist. She was the first woman of color executive director of Pacifica Radio and she has spent the last 30 years intimately involved in the media justice movement. Sharon created YMI as a resource for youth in the White Center community.  White Center is a low-income community with one of the highest high school drop out rates in the county. These communities are majority immigrant families from over 40 different countries, speaking 56 different home languages. Many youth in the area were thrilled at the opportunity to be apart of YMI and to explore how community media can be used as a means of empowerment in their lives.  In 2004, the first summer program was held. YMI collaborated with Third World Majority, a media justice collective from the Bay Area, to create an intensive video workshop for youth. It was highly successful as many youth participants went on to attend community colleges and become organizers and leaders within the community. Since then, YMI has continued to offer our summer program in partnership with other community organizations such as New Start, a local alternative high school. Many youth from these early years of YMI are still connected with us today.  After the 2006 summer program, YMI expanded into a year round program that allowed youth to build on the skills that they learned from the summer to create media projects for community organizations and events.  In 2007 we successfully completed another Youth Out Loud summer program in addition to various out-of-school workshops during the school year. Currently, YMI is continuing to expand in its membership, programming, and values. We are striving to build a foundation that is youth led, so that young media makers can mobilize together to create a sustainable foundation for the future, and to create a collective voice in the name of media justice.",(206) 762-2334,4408 Delridge Way SW #112,98106.0,-122.36301,47.56379,"(47.56379, -122.36301)"

Admittedly, the eradication of cancer and related diseases is an ambitious goal ? one that demands tenacity, scientific excellence, collaboration and breakthrough creativity. To accomplish this, the Hutchinson Center attracts some of the world's greatest minds.  Together our researchers discover new ways to detect cancers earlier, when cure rates are highest; develop effective treatments with fewer side effects; and learn how to prevent cancers from growing in the first place.

By supporting the Hutchinson Center, you will be funding new ideas and innovations in research as they emerge ? accelerating the ability to prevent, detect and treat cancer and related diseases.  Visit our website to learn more.","Although the doors to Fred Hutchinson opened in 1975, the history of the center actually began nearly 20 years earlier with the vision of Seattle surgeon Dr. William Hutchinson, brother of baseball hero Fred Hutchinson. Hutchinson dreamed of an organization that would provide funds and laboratory space that would allow physicians to pursue their research. In 1956, with the help of the U.S. Department of Public Health, he founded the Pacific Northwest Research Foundation. Initial study focused on heart surgery, cancer and endocrine diseases.   By 1962, Hutchinson envisioned another dream; a center devoted specifically to the study of cancer. After his beloved brother Fred died of cancer in 1964, the idea took shape, and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center was established in 1965 as the cancer division of the Foundation.  At the same time, Dr. E. Donnall Thomas and his colleagues on the East Coast had worked for decades on an innovative treatment for cancers of the blood. In the 1950s, they showed that dogs could be protected against lethal doses of irradiation by intravenous injection of bone-marrow cells. Thomas believed this had potential clinical applications for the treatment of leukemia in humans, and he set out to prove it.  Through painstaking laboratory and clinical research, Thomas improved the technique. In 1963, he came to Seattle to become the first director of the Division of Oncology at the University of Washington. Local institutions provided space for his radical yet promising transplant research. During the next few years, researchers from all over the world came to work with Thomas to do what most people were convinced would never work ? to cure cancer by transplanting human bone marrow after lethal doses of chemotherapy and radiation. What the team needed, however, was a permanent home to conduct their research.  At the Hutchinson Center, Thomas found that home. Hutchinson incorporated the center as an independent research institution in 1972. With the help of Washington state's legendary U.S. Senator Warren Magnuson and the Seattle community, federal and private funding led to the construction and opening of center's first home in Seattle's First Hill neighborhood in 1975.  Today, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is an institution of world-renowned depth and variety and home of three Nobel laureate.

219479.0,ArtsWest,ARTSWEST,,http://www.artswest.org,"ArtsWest produces artistic events so fiercely compelling that they require conversation, improve the imagination, and promote cultural vibrancy as a core value for the communities of West Seattle.","ArtsWest?s mission is outward-facing, one that measures success by response and not by the simple production of art.  We believe that it is not enough simply for an ArtsWest artistic event to be artistically excellent, an ?art for art?s sake? argument.  Rather, we believe that art is the most vibrant, nimble exercise in evoking discussion.  Requiring conversation from the production of art constructs a perfect confluence of tolerance, understanding, and intellectual growth.   ArtsWest?s mission is at the center of every decision, and at the same time, our mission allows us to set goals to increase diversities of age, race, sex, sexual orientation, and region.   As an art gallery with a free admission policy, we exhibit and sell the works of artists from across the region for the enjoyment and engagement of people from all over the Puget Sound area.  The ArtsWest Artists Association (AWAA) developed in 2001 out of the interest and enthusiasm of several local artists who believed that a visual artists group would benefit our local community and act as an additional enhancement to ArtsWest as an organization.    As a theater company, we are proud members of Theatre Puget Sound, a service organization founded to promote the spiritual and economic necessity of theatre to the people of the Puget Sound region.  ArtsWest?s theater work is based on the premise that good art inspires good ideas and encourages the kind of healthy, non-harmful debate that builds a sense of community.  We rally around the idea that producing plays and musicals that fit our mission by inducing conversation is more important than the simple production of the plays.  We adhere to the notion that for theatrical art to be significant, it has to be a means to an end, rather than the end itself.  As an arts education leader, ArtsWest is nationally renowned for its summer youth programs.  ArtsWest is one of only three arts organizations in the United States to receive three successive grants from the National Endowment for the Arts in support of the Summer Musical Theater Program.  ArtsWest's Summer Musical Theater Program serves area youth of all demographics.    As a community center and economic attractor, ArtsWest has served to build business in West Seattle, specifically in the Junction.  Using studies prepared by the University of Washington and GMA Research, ArtsFund has calculated that the economic impact of the arts on the communities of greater Seattle exceeded $1 billion dollars in 2003.  On average, ArtsWest?s arts patrons spend about $20 per person outside the cost of the ticket.  That allows a billowing positive economic impact within a community.  From 1999 - 2008, ArtsWest has provided an estimated direct positive economic impact of over $4 million.  And, because ArtsWest is by far the most prominent arts organization in West Seattle, that $4 million might have a) been spent in other parts of the city; or, likelier, b) not been spent at all.  ArtsWest?s financial well-being is crucial to the financial well-being of the Junction and of West Seattle.","ArtsWest is a non-profit, multi-disciplinary arts organization located in West Seattle with programs in theater, visual art, and education.  Since the late 1980s, this organization has presented works throughout West Seattle in various locations.

Communities In Schools of Seattle partners with Seattle Public Schools and primarily serves schools in economically disadvantaged areas with a disproportionately high number of ethnic minorities.","CISS has three main components to help students succeed.  School-wide prevention activities; Academic Support and Crisis Intervention.  School wide prevention events affect the entire school population, for example we host a school supply drive for over 26 schools within Seattle, coordinate Family Fitness Night for multiple schools to raise health awareness, and goal setting programs, to name a few.  Volunteer tutors are utilized in our academic programs for reading, math and general homework help at Elementary, Middle and High schools. These tutors have a direct impact in the lives of the students they serve.    It is far too often the case that students who struggle in school also face struggles at home. Unfortunately schools are not equipped to handled these challenges.  CISS places School Success Coordinators in designated schools to manage this gap.  Students are connected to resources that help them overcome personal challenges and become fully engaged in school.","Communities In Schools started as a grassroots movement in a few cities led by Bill Milliken. Bill and his colleagues worked with youth throughout the 1960's and 70's and out of his experience developed the ""Five Basics"" which still form the cornerstone of the CIS philosophy.   CIS understands that children who have access to caring adults, safe places to learn & grow, preventative health care, and opportunity are less likely to engage in risky behavior and are more likely to stay in school and make a positive contribution to their community.  Bill also realized that the so-called ""dropout problem"" begins long before kids reach age and that we need to get to young people before they give up on school. So he started to show communities how to work with their students inside the schools and coordinate existing community resources to serve kids more directly - inside their schools. Out of this Communities In Schools was born.  Since 1977 across the nation Communities In Schools has successfully lowered high school dropout rates and helped millions of young people choose a better path in life. Today CIS works with more than 2000 schools and provides access to nearly two million kids annually.",(206) 252-0173,6201 15th Ave NW #522,98107.0,-122.37647,47.67406,"(47.67406, -122.37647)"

Designated a national model by the Enterprise Foundation, Samaritan Inns has received the Terry McGovern Award for Excellence and Innovation  in Treatment.  It has been featured as a model for non-profit leadership in the twenty-first century.  Recently, Samaritan Inns was featured in the Chronicle of Philanthropy for spreading it?s innovative approach to other cities struggling with issues of homelessness and addiction through its mentoring system.  In 1999 Killian moved with her husband and two children to Seattle and, along with Randall Mullins, started the New Creation Community, an ecumenical faith community committed to contemplation and action and to standing in the ever widening gap between the world?s rich and poor.  That same year, in an effort to learn about the needs and responses to those needs in Seattle,  Killian began to visit a wide variety of non-profit agencies in Seattle and surrounding areas.   What she learned was that 50 to 70 % of the people living in Seattle?s shelters and transitional housing  are struggling with some form of addiction as well as other mental health challenges and that most of the housing programs do not have the funding or expertise to provide adequate recovery support for those individuals.  Without that support one?s efforts to break the cycle of homelessness often come unraveled.  Killian began to share this unmet need with others in New Creation Community.  Community members Ruby Takushi, a respected psychologist, Mary Crow, who has over 20 years experience in  recovery work, and Cecilia McKean, a nurse and counselor, stepped forward.  These women began to meet weekly at 6:00 AM to pray, dream and envision what their response would be to this critical need.  Others from New Creation Community joined in and generous visionaries invested in the dream.

Our vision is to inspire new thoughts and challenge assumptions about African-American culture.,"The Central District neighborhood has been the home of Seattle's African-American community for over 100 years. As Seattle evolves into an increasingly diverse city, so too has the Central District.  Gentrification and new economic realities are bringing new and different people together in a historically African-American neighborhood.

The CD Forum's programs have evolved to be the soul of Seattle's black sensibility--regardless of one's ethnicity. We present African-American culture in a radical new way: African-American as American and for every American.  Whether through the energy of the performing and literary arts, the insight of history, or the vibrancy of civic issues that reach out to families here and now, our multi-disciplinary programs offer art and the exploration of ideas as vehicles for social change, inspiring a desire for learning, creating a space for democratic community building, and instilling pride in our community.  Our successes provide remarkable examples of how our artistic leadership has resonated in our community. We have re-introduced Seattle to the diversity of talent in its midst and shown how creative presentations of African-American artforms can energize a community. In 2005, we were invited to join the Kennedy Center's Capacity Building Program for Culturally Specific Arts Organizations.  A tremendous honor, this program nurtures only the most promising culturally specific arts organizations so that they may realize their full potential in bringing diverse arts to the general public. In 2004, we received the Evergreen Award for Non-Profit Leadership, the Mayor's Art Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Community and Microsoft's Community Hero Award.","Each year we commission or present work that makes no assumptions about what African-American culture is or should be, but that reflects our differences and commonalities as Americans.  We have nurtured emerging artists by commissioning work like Venus Opal Reese's The Hair Monologues, a play that explores issues of black women and their hair, brought national artists and scholars to Seattle like novelists Walter Mosley, Edwidge Danticat, the world-renowned countertenor Derek Lee Ragin in recital, and the internationally acclaimed Brewery Puppet Troupe.  Last spring, we presented Hanifah Walidah's, Black Folks Guide to Black Folks, a one-woman, sold-out tour de force exploring homophobia in the black community.  The fall 2004 Which Way Seattle forum on race and political loyalty, The Black Vote, was a resounding success, as was the American Heritage Series' Blood Ties: Exploring the Black Native American Experience, which brought a packed audience of African-Americans, Native Americans and others together.  None of these programs cost more than $15 and most were as low as $5 for members, students or seniors.  We also commissioned special plays for youth, which are always free of charge.  They include Jacob, I Have Known (which took school children into the Harlem studio of Jacob Lawrence) and Harriet Goes to School: A Student's Life After Brown vs. Board of Education (which took students, teachers and parents into the home of fictitious Harriet Johnson, the first student to integrate her Greensboro, N.C. school).  Last December's Northwest Passages convened regional poets from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Eritrea, Somalia, Ghana and Ethiopia to read about their experiences as immigrants the Pacific Northwest.  As one teen said of this free program:  ""I have a greater understanding of first generation Africans in America. I have never heard the experience or the art of Africans and it was great.""   These and other events improve our region's quality of life, stimulate new ideas, and offer art and the humanities as vehicles for constructive social change.

The YWCA Culture Club (now The East Cherry Branch) also became, in 1919, one of the first public places available to the black community to meet.   This trend towards complete inclusiveness was echoed in 1947, when the facility was later renamed the Phylis Wheatley Branch, and became one of the first interracial YWCAs in the country. In the fifties, the YWCA expanded its programs to include child care and classes in child rearing, recreational programs, and camp programs.  In the sixties, the YWCA was a forerunner in supporting and educating on women's rights and civil rights.    This devotion to social justice continued into the seventies, as the YWCA featured workshops and programs aimed at eliminating racism and raising awareness within the community about the reality of oppression. In the past two decades, the YWCA has focused intensively on issues of homelessness and poverty, and the issues that surround and perpetuate those problems, in the larger community.",,2820 E Cherry Street,98122.0,-122.29527,47.60823,"(47.60823, -122.29527)"

Seward Park-with its remarkable natural assets and ideal location for achieving the organization?s goal of reaching out to communities underserved by environmental education-was the clear choice, and Audubon Washington initiated a proposal to the city.  In November 2000, city residents voted in support of a parks levy that earmarked $618,000 for the renovation of the Annex and Hatchery buildings at Seward Park.  Following this in June 2003, the Seattle City Council unanimously passed an ordinance supporting a partnership between the City and Audubon Washington. The two parties signed a Development Agreement and a 20-year Use and Occupancy Agreement three months later.   In July 2003, as part of the centennial celebration of the Olmsted park plan for the city, the Seattle Landmarks Board designated the Annex, built in 1927, a historic landmark building.  Seward Park is part of the Olmsted legacy and landscape heritage stemming from a formal plan compiled by John Charles Olmsted and adopted by the Seattle City Council in 1903.   In the final negotiations for the project, Audubon accepted responsibility for the estimated $2 million in planning, design, and renovation costs for the Annex building, while Seattle Parks accepted responsibility to remove the former fish hatchery ponds and renovate its buildings.   Pre-renovation design work for the Audubon Center began in September 2004 with a public meeting. In an effort to engage the public and ensure an inviting and welcoming design, three interactive exercises were facilitated in the local community, which included brainstorming and small group breakout sessions. Additional program feedback, received from community surveys and interviews, formed the foundation for the building program drafted by Mith?n Architects.    Mith?n and Audubon Washington?s pro-bono owner?s representative from Boeing worked with Audubon and Seattle Parks staff to begin schematic design in March 2005.  The design was completed in February 2006 and was submitted to the City of Seattle for construction permitting.  Upon adoption of this business plan and approval for construction by the National Audubon Society Board of Directors in Fall 2006, construction could begin.    Renovation on the Tudor-style house at the entrance to Seward Park was completed in April 2008.

In 1987 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation led the funding with a $1.2 million, a four-year grant to the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health to coordinate the community's response to the AIDS crisis. This grant resulted in the development and expansion of AIDS care services, including the Northwest AIDS Foundation, Chicken Soup Brigade and Harborview AIDS clinic.  One piece of that funding was to plan for housing and long-term care needs of PWAs.  Betsy Lieberman was hired to coordinate the planning.   She convened an AIDS Long-Term Care advisory committee of 22 which met for 7 months and recommended developing a 35-bed/room facility specializing in long-term care for persons with AIDS and incorporating an adult day health center.  Federal grant money was available for the construction of long-term care facilities for PWAs.  AIDS Housing of Washington was formed in May 1988 to make the committee's recommendation reality.  Fundraising began in earnest.  Within a month the fledgling organization signed options for our current Madison Valley plot.  At the same time, a partnership with the Sisters of Providence was formalized.   The fall of 1988, the community was notified, both formally and informally of the plans for the AIDS Housing of Washington project.  Almost immediately, controversy over the site arose.  Bit by bit, the community's fears were assuaged.  The groundbreaking ceremony  was October 10, 1990.  The site was dedicated as a healing site and participants ringed the site with banners in memory of loved ones.  The Sisters of Providence and AIDS Housing of Washington could not agree on a facility administrator so in March 1991 AIDS Housing began an evaluation of health-care providers that might be willing and able to do the job.   The group agreed that the lease should be offered to Virginia Medical Center.  Christine Hurley was hired by VM as administrator of the facility in July.  Construction was completed by W.G. Clark Construction Company in less than a year.  In January 1992 the building was dedicated and in June the first residents moved in and the first clients came for service.

Approximately 70% of JWC residents have a history of domestic violence. JWC, with a capacity to house 34 women, provides one-quarter of Seattle's transitional housing for homeless women.

Seattle was struggling with the ""Boeing Bust"", the area's worst recession since the 1930's. At one point someone erected a billboard reading, ""Will the last person to leave Seattle, please turn off the lights?""  As fall came, the days shortened, the rains arrived and the air cooled into one of Seattle's coldest winters. A local incident demonstrated how the lines between national and local issues could easily become one. An anti-poverty program had been abruptly defunded, sparking and issue that led to the creation of El Centro de la Raza.  Several dozen Latino students of the English and Adult Basic Education Program at the Duwamish branch of South Seattle Community College found themselves without an educational home. On October 11, 1972 core staff, students and their families peacefully occupied the abandoned Beacon Hill School near downtown Seattle.  The people who had peacefully occupied the Beacon Hill School created a community, without running water and heat, as negotiations took place with the City of Seattle and Seattle Public Schools. At one point it became necessary to occupy the Seattle City Council Chambers to underscore the determination to develop an authentic community center on the site.  One of the key debates raged around the most appropriate location for the Latino center. The occupants were convinced that the Beacon Hill site was the most appropriate because of it's centralized location, availability, and potential for expansion and development.  The final approval from the Mayor to secure the facility came only after the peaceful occupation and subsequent arrest of El Centro leaders. The three-month occupation, in one of Seattle's coldest winters, resulted in a five year lease of the building at $1 a year.  After the victory, the people of El Centro began an extraordinary journey. Over the past three decades people's sweat equity, songs and study have built one of the largest and most productive community based organizations in the nation.",,2524 16th Ave South,98144.0,-122.31132,47.58034,"(47.58034, -122.31132)"
